# Dispatcharr-Channel-Logo-Auto-Grab-Auto-Assign
Automatically finds, downloads, and assigns channel logos from the open tvlogos catalog to Dispatcharr channels that are missing a proper logo. It skips channels that already have a healthy non-placeholder logo and writes only to the configured logos directory.
